## Installation
1. Ensure you have the latest version of [Exiled](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) installed on your server.
2. Download the `FunnyPills.dll` from the [releases page](#).
3. Place the `FunnyPills.dll` file in your Exiled `Plugins` folder.
4. Restart your server, and the plugin will automatically load.

If you encounter a problem with the Custom Item ID conflicting with other custom items on your server, we recommend changing the Custom Item ID of the Funny Pills to item ID `30`. This adjustment can be made in the plugin's configuration file, ensuring compatibility and preventing overlaps with other custom items.
